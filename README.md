<h3>Purpose of project</h3> 

The purpose of the meeting scheduler system is to support the organization of meetings - that is, to determine, for each meeting request, a meeting date and location so that most of the intended participants will effectively participate. The meeting date and location thus be as convenient as possible to all participants. Information about the meeting also be made available as early as possible to all potential participants by email for all meeting participants. The intended system considerably reduce the amount of overhead usually incurred in organizing meetings where potential attendees are distributed over many different places. On another hand, the system reflect as closely as possible the way meetings 

The system should assist users to plan meetings under the constraints expressed by participants, re-plan a meeting dynamically to support as much flexibility as possible. On one hand, participants should be allowed to modify their exclusion set, preference set and/or preferred location before a meeting date/location is proposed. On the other hand, it should be possible to take some external constraints into account after a date and location have been proposed - e.g., due to the need to accommodate a more important meeting. The original meeting date or location may then need to be changed; sometimes the meeting may even be cancelled. In all cases some bound on re-planning should be set up.
